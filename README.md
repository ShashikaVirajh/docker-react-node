## Overview
This is a full-stack application built using React for the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. Everything is Dockerized for consistent development and deployment.

## Technologies Used
- FrontEnd: React
- Backend: Node, Express, MongoDB
- Containerization: Docker

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### Installation
Run the following command to get the app up and running:
\`\`\`bash
docker-compose up
\`\`\`

## Docker Essentials

### Images
Images are like blueprints that define how containers should behave.
- **Backend Image**: Builds from a Node.js base and includes your backend code.
- **Frontend Image**: Also builds from a Node.js base but is configured to run your React app.

### Containers
Containers are running instances of images. You'll have one for the frontend, another for the backend, and a third for MongoDB.

### Volumes
Volumes help in persisting data. Here, we use one for MongoDB to store our database between runs.

## Project Architecture

### Backend Dockerfile
Sets up a Node.js environment and prepares the backend for running.
\`\`\`Dockerfile
# Your backend Dockerfile content
\`\`\`

### Frontend Dockerfile
Sets up a Node.js environment optimized for running a React app.
\`\`\`Dockerfile
# Your frontend Dockerfile content
\`\`\`

### Docker-Compose File
Orchestrates the services defined in the Dockerfiles. Specifies ports, volumes, and environment variables.
\`\`\`yaml
# Your Docker-Compose file content
\`\`\`

### Docker Entrypoint Scripts
These scripts ensure dependent services like MongoDB are ready before the application starts running.
\`\`\`sh
# Your docker-entrypoint.sh content
\`\`\`

## Why Use Docker and Docker Compose

**Docker**: Provides isolation, making it easier to build, run, and deploy your app.

**Docker Compose**: Helps manage multi-container setups like ours. Great for local development and initial stage deployments.
